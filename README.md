djtpl: A Project Template for Django
=========================

djtpl is a rather opinionated start to a new Django project. It includes a few things so that you donâ€™t have to worry about dealing with them in order to get up and running.

## Quickstart
```
virtualenv env
. ./env/bin/activate
pip install django
django-admin.py startproject my_project --template=https://github.com/Brant/djtpl/archive/master.zip
pip install -r my_project/requirements.txt
```
